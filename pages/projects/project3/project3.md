> Please take the time to read through the project spec. Project 3 will go more efficiently and smoothly for you, your team, and facilitators if you understand the logistics. 


## Overview 
For the final project you will be working in teams of 3-5 for the rest of the semester to make a game based on your original pitches. Each team will be paired with a facilitator, who will help guide progress and provide feedback to ensure your final game is as strong and polished as possible.

## Pitches & Pitch Day 
Unlike previous projects, **you** will propose your own project theme. You have complete creative freedom in developing your game concept; however, we encourage you to be thoughtful and intentional, as your idea may be selected to become a Project 3 game. Please fill out the [Pitch Form](https://tinyurl.com/s26pitch) before class <span style="color:blue"> **Tuesday, March 3** </span>. 

We will dedicate a class session to Pitch Day, where students may present their Project 3 ideas. Projects that generate the most interest will move forward as final project groups. 

Some important notes: 
- We recommend preparing slides for your presentation, though this is not required. You are welcome to present without slides if you prefer.
- You are not limited to the idea you submitted in the form. Concepts often evolve, and you may present a different pitch if you choose.
- While we **strongly** encourage you create your pitch with the intention of presenting it and potentially developing it into a Project 3 game, **presenting is optional**. However, only pitches presented in class will be eligible for selection as a Project 3 game.

## Milestones
Milestones occur every 1-3 weeks until the end of the semester. At each milestone date, your team will present the current version of your game through a miniature **showcase**. You will be assigned specific teams to playtest, and in turn, other teams will playtest your game. To guide feedback, your team must prepare a set of playtesting questions **in advance** and submit them to **your facilitator** before the milestone.

Between each milestone your team will update its mentor and the mentor will provide feedback and assistance based on the game’s progress. **Each Milestone will be graded.**

For reference: 
**Grade Breakdown (Per Milestone)**
* Mentor evaluation: 40%
* Peer evaluations: 40%
* Project score: 20%

{: .note}
Milestones are **adaptive**. While all teams are expected to meet the milestone deadlines, the **specific goals** may differ according to respective progress made by each team. Milestones are meant to help keep teams on track in areas they need to work on, as well as implementing new and fun ideas.

<br>

| Milestone | Due Date | Requirements |
|:-----------:|:----------:|:--------------|
| Milestone 0: <br> **Design Doc** | **March 10th** | Game [design document] that must include all of the following sections:<br>• Objective (max: 3 sentences)<br>• Description (min: 2 paragraphs)<br>• Mechanics (min: 3 mechanics)<br>• Genre/Platform (max: 3 sentences)<br>• Aesthetics (min: 1 paragraph)<br>• Feature List (seven to fifteen features)<br>• Division of Tasks<br>• Schedule<br>• Others (optional)<br><br>Try to keep this updated so that your group can stay coordinated. You can even refer to this if you mention your game on your resume. <br><br>[SUBMIT HERE](https://tinyurl.com/s26p3designdoc){: .btn .btn-purple} |
| Milestone 1: <br> **MVP** | **March 12th** | Your MVP must be complete (refer to the [MVP] lecture). Playable prototype of the original pitch. <br>• At least two of the core mechanics implemented<br>• No art needs to be in place yet <br> <br> Effectively this milestone exists to ensure that your game will be fun, and to get feedback on how it can be improved if it’s not shaping up to be what you expected. |
| Milestone 2: <br> **Alpha Build** | **April 2nd** | • All mechanics should be in place/in a testable state. <br>• Your general art style should be decided on <br>• A few assets added in <br>• You should have a basic level <br> **This build may have bugs.** |
| Milestone 3: <br> **Beta Build** | **April 16th** | • **All levels should be built** <br>• **All mechanics should be implemented** <br>• A first pass should have been done on all art assets, and they should be in the game <br> <br> There may be bugs and glitches, but the game should be starting to look like the final product at this point. |
| Milestone 4: <br> **Finished Project** | **April 30th** | • The game should be complete, and in line with the original pitch. <br>• It should be playable from start to finish, and mostly bug free. <br> <br> You will also be required to make a 9x9 graphic with the game’s title for showcase, and a 30–60 second trailer. If you need help making a trailer, here are a few options and guidelines: [Trailer Guide] |

<!-- ## Team Shares
Each week we’ll be having project work sessions; a chance in class to work on the project. You’ll be required to do a teamshare with your assigned mentor during this time. A teamshare is where each team member shares what they’re working on and what they need to continue.

Every week where there is a teamshare, you will receive a **mentor evaluation** score. This score will range from 1-4. The guidelines for each score are:
1 - You accomplished nothing or nearly nothing
2 - You finished some things but were below the expectations set the previous week
3 - You did everything you said you would
4 - You went above and beyond -->

## Progresss Reports
Each team will maintain a weekly progress report, which will contribute to their overall **mentor evaluation**. These reports are used to track participation and accountability; if a team member consistently shows little progress or poor participation, it will be reflected in their evaluation. A week's progress report will be reviewed the following week, Tuesday. 

We have provided a [template] to use at your discretion.

Each person is responsible for maintaining their own slide. The slide should briefly detail what they accomplished during the week, along with reflections on progress. Possible guiding questions include:
* What did you do this week?
* Tasks assigned vs. tasks completed
* What went well, and what didn’t?
* Any key updates?
* Goals for next week

## Final Submission
In order to receive a grade, your game **must be uploaded to itch.io** and you **must create a short trailer approximately 30-60 seconds in length** showing off your game. 

**Grade Breakdown (Per Milestone)**
* Mentor evaluation: 40%
* Peer evaluations: 40%
* Project score: 20%
