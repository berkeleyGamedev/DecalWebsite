## Overview 
For the final project you will be working in teams of 3-5 for the rest of the semester to make a game based on your original pitches. Each team will be paired with a facilitator, who will help guide progress and provide feedback to ensure your final game is as strong and polished as possible.

## Milestones 

Milestones occur every 1-3 weeks until the end of the semester. At each milestone, your team's game . To gather feedback, each playtest will require a set of questions that you want playtesters to answer. Between each milestone your team will update its mentor and the mentor will provide feedback and assistance based on the game’s progress. **Each Milestone will be graded.**

For reference: 
**Grade Breakdown (Per Milestone)**
* Mentor evaluation: 40%
* Peer evaluations: 40%
* Project score: 20%

| Milestone | Due Date | Requirements |
|:-----------:|:----------:|:--------------|
| Milestone 0: <br> **Design Doc** | **Oct 16th** | Game design document that must include all of the following sections:<br>• Objective (max: 3 sentences)<br>• Description (min: 2 paragraphs)<br>• Mechanics (min: 3 mechanics)<br>• Genre/Platform (max: 3 sentences)<br>• Aesthetics (min: 1 paragraph)<br>• Feature List (seven to fifteen features)<br>• Division of Tasks<br>• Schedule<br>• Others (optional)<br><br>Try to keep this updated so that your group can stay coordinated. You can even refer to this if you mention your game on your resume.<br><br>[SUBMIT HERE](https://tinyurl.com/f25mile0dd){: .btn .btn-purple} |
| Milestone 1: <br> **MVP** | **Oct 23th** | Your MVP must be complete (refer to the [MVP] lecture). Playable prototype of the original pitch. <br>• At least two of the core mechanics implemented<br>• No art needs to be in place yet <br> <br> Effectively this milestone exists to ensure that your game will be fun, and to get feedback on how it can be improved if it’s not shaping up to be what you expected. |
| Milestone 2: <br> **Alpha Build** | **Nov 6th** | • All mechanics should be in place/in a testable state. <br>• Your general art style should be decided on <br>• A few assets added in <br>• You should have a basic level <br> **This build may have bugs.** |
| Milestone 3: <br> **Beta Build** | **Nov 20th** | • **All levels should be built** <br>• **All mechanics should be implemented** <br>• A first pass should have been done on all art assets, and they should be in the game <br> <br> There may be bugs and glitches, but the game should be starting to look like the final product at this point. |
| Milestone 4: <br> **Finished Project** | **Dec 4th** | • The game should be complete, and in line with the original pitch. <br>• It should be playable from start to finish, and mostly bug free. <br> <br> You will also be required to make a 9x9 graphic with the game’s title for showcase, and a 30–60 second trailer. If you need help making a trailer, here are a few options and guidelines: [Trailer Guide] |
| **GDD Showcase** | **Dec 9th** | Show off your game to the whole club and see what other games people have been working on this semester! <br> <img src="../images/pepe_dance.gif" alt="pepe" width="30" height="30">|

## Playtests
At each milestone date, your team will present the current version of your game through a miniature showcase. In this showcase, you will be assigned certain teams whose games you need to play and give feedback on.

In order to assist your team in getting feedback, we will provide a classwide feedback form where you will be able to pose questions to your peers during each milestone, these questions will be determined **beforehand** and given to your facilitator **before the milestone**. During the playtest, each student is expected to submit a feedback form for three different games.

The final project showcase will be held in Jacobs.

{: .note}
Milestones are **adaptive**. While all teams are expected to meet the milestone deadlines, the **specific goals** may differ according to respective progress made by each team. Milestones are meant to help keep teams on track in areas they need to work on, as well as implementing new and fun ideas.

## Team Shares
Each week we’ll be having project work sessions; a chance in class to work on the project. You’ll be required to do a teamshare with your assigned mentor during this time. A teamshare is where each team member shares what they’re working on and what they need to continue.

Every week where there is a teamshare, you will receive a **mentor evaluation** score. This score will range from 1-4. The guidelines for each score are:
1 - You accomplished nothing or nearly nothing
2 - You finished some things but were below the expectations set the previous week
3 - You did everything you said you would
4 - You went above and beyond

## Progresss Reports
Each team will maintain a weekly progress report, which will contribute to their overall **mentor evaluation**. These reports are used to track participation and accountability; if a team member consistently shows little progress or poor participation, it will be reflected in their evaluation.

Progress reports will be reviewed by facilitators and mentors during team share time the following week. 

We have provided a [template] to use at your discretion.

Each person is responsible for maintaining their own slide. The slide should briefly detail what they accomplished during the week, along with reflections on progress. Possible guiding questions include:
* What did you do this week?
* Tasks assigned vs. tasks completed
* What went well, and what didn’t?
* Any key updates?
* Goals for next week

## Final Submission
In order to receive a grade, your game **must be uploaded to itch.io** and you **must create a short trailer approximately 30-60 seconds in length** showing off your game. 

**Grade Breakdown (Per Milestone)**
* Mentor evaluation: 40%
* Peer evaluations: 40%
* Project score: 20%
