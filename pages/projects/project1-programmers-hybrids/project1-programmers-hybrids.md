## Overview
The goal of this project is to familiarize you with Unity, guide you through making a game from start to finish and designing and implementing new aspects into a game. There are two parts to the project. The first is following a tutorial in which you will create the game using videos that will guide you step by step. The second is an open ended section where you build off of part 1. **You only need to do the Part 2 corresponding to your role.**

## Part 1: Base Project

**Note**: The tutorials are done in a different version of Unity, but you should do yours in **6000.0.32f1**. The project files have been updated to this version.

Select between the two tutorials:
* 2D Project
    * A top down 2D hack n slash with mechanics similar to the original Legend of Zelda
    * [2D Github Repo]
    * [2D Spec]
* 3D Project
    * A first person, 3D platformer and shooter with elemental attacks
    * [3D Github Repo]
    * [3D Playlist] (2.5 - 3 hrs)

Download the projects from Github, unzip the project and complete the tutorials linked in the Youtube Playlist.

## Part 2: Programmers
* 2D project:
    * Select 2 or more of the following features from the list below and implement them within your game:

## Grading
Project 1 will be graded P/NP. Part 1 will be graded on completion, based on if the project is completed up to the standard of the video tutorials. Part 2 will be graded on completion of implementing new mechanics, enemies, item, etc based on the requirements.

## Submission 
For part 1, upload your project to Github in a private repo and share it with berkeleyGamedev. The game should be able to be played without compiler errors. If there is an error that prevents the project from being graded, you will be notified after submission and given 24 hours to send corrections so that it is playable. Do not add new content. 
After projects have been graded, you will receive feedback on your project. 
For part 2, upload your project to a new Github repo and fill out the respective form.
