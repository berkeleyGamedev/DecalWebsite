## Overview
The goal of this project is to familiarize you with Unity, guide you through making a game from start to finish and designing and implementing new aspects into a game. There are two parts to the project. The first is following a tutorial in which you will create the game using videos that will guide you step by step. Part 2 is an open ended section, building off of the first part. **You only need to do the Part 2 corresponding to your role.**

## Part 1: Base Project

{: .note} 
> The tutorials are done in a different version of Unity, but you should do yours in **6000.0.49f1**. The project files have been updated to this version.

There are two versions of the base project. Please choose **one**, download the Github Project, and follow its corresponding spec instructions. 

1. **2D Project**
    * A top down 2D hack n slash with mechanics similar to the original Legend of Zelda
    * [2D Github Repo]
    * [2D Spec]
2. **3D Project**
    * A first person, 3D platformer and shooter with elemental attacks
    * [3D Github Repo]
    * [3D Playlist] (2.5 - 3 hrs)

{: .highlight}
> Project 1 will be graded P/NP. **Part 1** will be graded on completion, based on if the project is completed up to the standard of the video tutorials. **Part 2** will be graded on completion of implementing new mechanics, enemies, item, etc based on the requirements.

### Submission 

Ensure that your github repo is **private** and invite <span style="color:blue;">berkeleyGameDev</span> as a collaborator.

Your base project should be able to be played *without compiler errors*. If there is an error that prevents the project from being graded, you will be notified after submission and given 24 hours to send corrections so that it is playable. 

**Do not add new content.** If we see that there has been new content added in your corrected version, you will receive an **automatic NP grade**. 

After projects have been graded, you will receive feedback on your project. 

**Part 1 Due Thursday, 9/18 @ 6:59 PM.**

## Part 2

Part 2 is the open-ended portion of Project 1, where you expand on the base game. Since it is **role-specific**, you only need to focus on the assigned tasks for your role. You’ll be graded according to those requirements, but you’re encouraged to explore further if you want to!
