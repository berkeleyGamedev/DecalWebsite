___

In this section, we will be kicking off our game development journey by creating the player and implementing their basic actions. By the end of this section your player will be able to:

1. Move in four directions
2. Attack in four directions

{: .note}
> An important part of debugging in Unity is using `Debug.Log()`, or print statements to figure out the output of your code, if objects are properly assigned to variables, and generally to gain some sort of insight on what your code is doing. Use these to your advantage if you get stuck debugging, such as figuring out where NullReferenceExceptions are coming from!

### Player Movement

**Summary:**

1. Create the player object, and add the player movement script
2. Be able to move the player object in any direction.

Open up the *SampleScene* scene located in `assets/scenes`. You should see a grassy 2D map in your scene view. 
Look in the hierarchy and select the *Player* object. In the *Sprite Renderer* component, change the Sprite from None to `idle_east_1`.

Add a new component titled *Rigidbody 2D* and a *Capsule Collider 2D*. Make sure that the `Body Type` for the Rigidbody component is `Dynamic` and `Gravity Scale` is `0`. Under **constraints**, Check the `Freeze Rotation` box as well.

In the `Capsule Collider`, we want to set the hitbox of the sprite to be the same size as the sprite. In order to add some depth, we will set the hitbox as the feet of the sprite. You may use the numbers in the image below, and to check if your `Rigidbody` is also correct.
![Alt text](images/fig1.2.png) Fig 1.1

You should see the *Player.cs* script already attached to the Player. Double click it, and open up the script.

{: .note}
> There are two ways to open the script. You can either double click on it via the project directory or through the inspector by clicking on the three dots > edit script. 

In order to keep our code clean, we will use `#region` boundaries to sort and organize our variables. You can see it in the given code here.

```
#region Movement_variables
public float movespeed;
float x_input;
float y_input;
#endregion

#region Physics_components
Rigidbody2D PlayerRB;
#endregion

#region Unity_functions
private void Awake()
{

}

private void Update()
{

}
#endregion

```

- `movespeed` will control how fast the player can move. Note that it is public, such that we can edit it in the inspector in real time to try different speeds. 
- `x_input` and `y_input` will be used to determine where the player should be going based on the user input. 
- `PlayerRb` will control the forces we add onto the player.
- `Awake()` is called ONCE when the object is created, and never again.
- `Update()` is called EVERY frame. This means that **we do not want any intensive or heavy code in Update** as that would be costly, and could lag, or even crash your game. 

Here, we will leave you with a small coding exercise. If you can't do it off the top of your head, no worries! You can follow the project video linked with the timestamp.

**Task 1.1:**

- In `Update()`, you will need to do two things.
  1. Access the user input values (button presses that correspond to the movement in the game) and map them in `Update()`.
     -  This will require you access the Input Manager which is located in `Edit -> Project Settings -> Input Manager->Axes` to determine which buttons the project assumes as the positive and negative button for horizontal and vertical movement. For our case, we will use WASD.
     -  Use the function `Input.GetAxisRaw()` to get the raw input for the horizontal and vertical movement (which should be a value from -1 to 1), and set them to `x_input` and `y_input` respectively. **HINT: `Input.GetAxisRaw()` takes in a singular string as its argument. Link to documentation: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Input.GetAxisRaw.html**
  2. Call the Move() function after you've stored the user input values.
- Now, Implement the Move() function inside the `Movement_functions` region which will move the player based on the `x_input` and `y_input`.
  -  You will need 5 cases to determine what the player should do.
  -  Set `PlayerRB.velocity` to `Vector2.up/down/left/right/zero` based on which case you are on.
  -  The player's velocity should be scaled by `moveSpeed`
 
Functions to modify: 

*PlayerController.cs* -> `Update()` and `Move()`

```

To check if we have coded this correctly, put in some value for `moveSpeed` (staff solution uses a value of 2f) and see if the player moves with the WASD keys.

{: .note}
> If you are having trouble viewing your player, you might have to adjust the z axis of the Main Camera object. First, uncheck the *CinemachineBrain* component, and set the Z position to be -3.

{: .highlight}
> You may notice that some keys override the keys of others (when pushing both down and left, your character may only go left), as a design choice, we do not support diagonal movement. Feel free to improve / change this function from the tutorial code as you see fit.

### Player Attacks

**Summary:**

1. Be able to attack when pressing the "J" key in all four directions
2. Cast the hitbox in the right direction
3. Add animations

Find these regions in your *PlayerController* script, which will define some new variables for you.

```
#region Attack_variables
public float Damage;
float attackSpeed = 1;
float attackTimer;
public float hitBoxTiming;
public float endAnimationTiming;
bool isAttacking;
Vector2 currDirection;
#endregion

#region Attack_functions
private void Attack()
{
    Debug.Log("attacking now");
}

IEnumerator AttackRoutine()
{
    yield return null;
}

#endregion
```
- `Damage` is how much damage you do each hit.
- `attackSpeed` is how long you need to wait before you have to attack again. 
- `attackTimer` will work with `attackSpeed` by timing when the player last hit. On attacking, it will reset, and count down once more.
- `hitBoxTiming` and `endAnimationTiming` will allow us to have a delay from when the animation starts, to when we actually hit the enemy. This will make the animation feel more convincing by having it hit when the sword is being swung, rather than when it is winding up.
- `isAttacking` will let us know if the user has inputted an attack, which will then pause our movement.
- `currDirection` will make sure that if we attack right, we attack right, rather than to a different direction.
- `Attack()` is the function that will be called when the player attacks.
- `AttackRoutine()` will handle animations and hitboxes for the attack mechanisms. 

{: .note}
> You may notice that the data type of the `AttackRoutine()` function is an IEnumerator rather than a public or private function. This is an example of a **coroutine** which you will learn about in a later lab. If you have taken 61A, it is similar to yield functions and generators.

**Task 1.2: Choose an Attack key, and in `Update()`, call the private `Attack()` function when your chosen attack key is pressed down. You will need to use `Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode key)` function to determine if your chosen key is being pressed. The staff solution uses the J key as the attack key**

Functions to modify:

*PlayerController.cs* -> `Update()`

{: .important}
> Below is the hex code for the solution.
```
68 74 74 70 73 3A 2F 2F 79 6F 75 74 75 2E 62 65 2F 64 73 4D 6B 44 6E 75 43 64 2D 41 3F 6C 69 73 74 3D 50 4C 6B 54 71 66 35 44 42 7A 50 73 41 65 2D 70 52 35 62 44 55 64 77 48 69 43 4E 67 48 63 79 42 49 68 26 74 3D 31 31 34 39
```

If you save, press play, and press your attack key, you should see in the bottom left a print statement saying `attacking now`. This is your console, and will be very helpful in debugging, and testing code in labs, and projects. It will also display any warnings, and errors that you may have.

{: .note}
> For now we just want to check if the attack key is working; you will implement the attacking logic in a later section.

We will now make it such that you cannot spam the ability as fast as you can using the `attackSpeed` and `attackTimer` variables. 

{: .hint}
> Re-read the definitions for `attackSpeed` and `attackTimer` above to understand how you can utilize these two variables to implement an attack cooldown.

Initialize the `attackTimer` variable in `Awake()` to 0, as that will indicate that we can attack again. 

**Task 1.3: In Update(), modify your attacking conditional statement to only call `Attack()` when attackTimer < 0. If not, we don't want to attack, and subtract `Time.deltaTime`, but if we do attack, we want to call the `Attack()` function AND set attackTimer to attackSpeed` to reset the cooldown.**

Functions to modify: 

*PlayerController.cs* -> `Update()`
*PlayerController.cs* -> `Attack()`

{: .note}
> You can complete this task by only modifying `Update()` but the code will be more clean if you seperate your logic between the two functions `Update()` and `Attack()`

{: .important}
> Below is the hex code for the solution.
```
68 74 74 70 73 3A 2F 2F 79 6F 75 74 75 2E 62 65 2F 64 73 4D 6B 44 6E 75 43 64 2D 41 3F 6C 69 73 74 3D 50 4C 6B 54 71 66 35 44 42 7A 50 73 41 65 2D 70 52 35 62 44 55 64 77 48 69 43 4E 67 48 63 79 42 49 68 26 74 3D 31 33 34 30
```

Back in the Unity editor, if you select the Player object, there will be an input field for AttackSpeed, set it to 3, save, and play the game to see if the cooldown is working. 

Notice when we walk in different directions, the player sprite doesn't switch the way it is facing, and it can only attack in one direction.

**Task 1.4: Inside of the `Move()` function, set `currDirection` to the new direction you're moving towards. For instance, if we are moving to the left, we would set `currDirection = Vector2.left;` `currDirection` will be used to orient the player sprite when performing basic actions.**

{: .note}
> You only need to worry about setting currDirection, the function `AttackRoutine()` and the starter code for `Move()` will use `currDirection` to set the correct Player sprite when walking and attacking, that is already taken care of for you. If you would like to set the details of the implementation look inside `AttackRoutine()` and `Move()` or look through the video which implements it from scratch. *Note: the attack animation won’t work until we correctly implement `AttackRoutine()`”


Functions to modify: 

*PlayerController.cs* -> `Move()`

{: .important}
> Below is the hex code for the solution.

```
68 74 74 70 73 3A 2F 2F 77 77 77 2E 79 6F 75 74 75 62 65 2E 63 6F 6D 2F 77 61 74 63 68 3F 76 3D 64 73 4D 6B 44 6E 75 43 64 2D 41 26 6C 69 73 74 3D 50 4C 6B 54 71 66 35 44 42 7A 50 73 41 65 2D 70 52 35 62 44 55 64 77 48 69 43 4E 67 48 63 79 42 49 68 26 74 3D 31 33 34 30 73
```

You can now check to make sure that it works by adding another Debug statement in `Attack()` to check the current direction with `Debug.Log(currDirection);` which will print out two values to display the current direction. 

Finally, in the inspector, change the AttackSpeed to 0.5, since we don't only want to be able to attack every 3 seconds.

Now, we will start on being able to cast the hitbox in the right direction, which is already done for you in the coroutine, or the `IEnumerator` function titled `AttackRoutine()`. **You only need to modify the `Attack()` function by calling `AttackRoutine()` using the function `StartCoroutine()`.**

{: .hint}
> `StartCoroutine()` takes in a coroutine/IEnumerator as its only argument. https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.StartCoroutine.html

Here is a breakdown of the `AttackRoutine()` function:

```
IEnumerator AttackRoutine()
{
    isAttacking = true;
    PlayerRB.velocity = Vector2.zero;
    yield return new WaitForSeconds(hitBoxTiming);
    Debug.Log("Casting hitbox now");
    RaycastHit2D[] hits = Physics2D.BoxCastAll(PlayerRB.position + currDirection, Vector2.one, 0f, Vector2.zero);

    foreach(Hit2D hit in hits)
    {
        if(hit.transform.CompareTag("Enemy"))
        {
            Debug.Log("Tons of damage");
        }
    }

    yield return new WaitForSeconds(hitBoxTiming);
    isAttacking = false;
}
```
  - We set `isAttacking` to true, and set the player's velocity to 0, as, a design choice, the player will not be able to move when they attack.
  - `yield return new WaitForSeconds(hitBoxTiming);` will basically pause the running of the function for `hitBoxTiming` number of seconds before running the next line.
  - `hits` is an array of all the objects that are colliding with a box that is in front of the player. To learn more about `BoxCastAll`, you can check out the function description [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Physics2D.BoxCastAll.html). **We highly suggest you read through the documentation and understand what each input is.** The video also describes each variable at the timestamp given below.
  - We will then iterate through each hit that we found from our , and if it has the tag of "Enemy", will print the statement "Tons of damage".
  - We will then wait `hitBoxTiming` seconds, and then set `isAttacking` back to false.

A video breakdown of this function is avaliable here:

```
68 74 74 70 73 3A 2F 2F 79 6F 75 74 75 2E 62 65 2F 64 73 4D 6B 44 6E 75 43 64 2D 41 3F 6C 69 73 74 3D 50 4C 6B 54 71 66 35 44 42 7A 50 73 41 65 2D 70 52 35 62 44 55 64 77 48 69 43 4E 67 48 63 79 42 49 68 26 74 3D 31 37 37 39
```

Go back into Unity, and set the Player object to have the Player tag. This will be right under the Object name. 

{: .note}
> Tags are labels we can assign to every game object, and is useful in selecting specific types of objects.

Now, add an `if` statement at the very beginning of `Update()` to check if `isAttacking` is true. If so, then just return. 

Save your script, and go back into the inspector for the Player object. Set the following variables to these values:

![Default variable values for Player](images/fig1.3.png) Fig 1.2

- `Movespeed` to 2
- `Damage` to 2
- `AttackSpeed` to 0.5
- `hitBoxTiming` and `endAnimationTiming` to 0.1

Except for `hitBoxTiming` and `endAnimationTiming`, feel free to adjust the other variables to whatever values you desire; these are just values for the staff solution.

{: .note}
> Make sure you are constantly saving your project using either `Ctrl+S` or `File > Save` whenever you make changes to it. Unity can crash at any time, so saving frequently can reduce the damage done to your progress when these unlikely scenarios may occur.

If you press Play, you will now see that if you attack, the player will pause for a brief moment before resuming movement.

![Gif to show example of final result for section 1](images/example-final.gif) Fig 1.3

Congrationlations on finishing this long and tedious section! Feel free to take a tea break before moving onto the next section (:

{: .note}
> You should also see the `anim` variable sprinkled around in the code. This will take care of the animation side of the player, which we have already provided for you.

## Section 2: Creating the Enemies

In the arena of challenges, foes emerge as catalysts for resilience and architects of growth. Embrace the dance with adversaries, for it is through the crucible of opposition that the strength of character is forged.

In this section, we'll be designing a enemy for the player to fight. The enemy will have a circular line of sight that, when the player enters, triggers the enemy to chase the player and explode upon contact; dealing damage to the player. The player will also be able to deal damage back to the enemy.

**Summary:**

1. Create an enemy that tracks and chases the player
2. When the enemy makes contact with the player, it explodes and deals damage to the player
3. Implement the ghost walking animation for the enemy

### Enemy Setup

First, create an empty GameObject by right clicking in the hierarchy and name it `Enemy`. Attach a *SpriteRenderer*, *Rigidbody2D*, and a *CircleCollider2D*.

In the *SpriteRenderer* component, change the Sprite from *None* to *Enemy 1*. 

If you can't see the Enemy GameObject, this is because it is hidden behind the *Grassy Map* layer. To fix this, still inside *SpriteRenderer*, **change the Sorting Layer from Default to Enemy**

Look at the **RigidBody2D** component:

![](./images/fig2.1.png) Fig 2.1

- Set the gravity scale to zero (fig 2.1) 
- Check the box next to rotation to freeze the z rotation (fig 2.1)

For the **Circle Collider 2D**, you can leave everything default

Finally, attach the `Enemy.cs` script to the enemy GameObject and set it's tag to Enemy.

Now, we have a basic enemy GameObject. 

### Setting Up Enemy Line of Sight

An enemy should attack the player if the player is within a certain radius. 

To get started on a detection system, make a empty GameObject named `LineOfSight`; this object should be **a child of the Enemy GameObject**. In order to parent them, in your hierarchy, select and drag the child object (LineOfSight) over the parent object (Enemy), if you let go of the mouse button and drop the object ontop of `Enemy`, `LineOfSight` should get indented and is now a child of the `Enemy` GameObject.

Now, look at the inspector column and click the three dots at the top-right of the Transform component, select *Reset*. This ensures the `LineOfSight` GameObject is at the center of the `Enemy` GameObject.

Attach a *CircleCollider2D* to your newly created *LineOfSight* GameObject. When the player enters this circle collider, it will notify the enemy to move and attack the player. You must make two changes:

- Check the *IsTrigger* box. This way your circle collider won't bump into other objects
- Adjust the radius of the collider to your desired range (staff solution uses a radius of 4)

![](./images/fig2.2.png) Fig 2.2

Lastly, attach your `LineOfSight.cs` script to your *LineOfSight* GameObject.

### The Enemy Script

Now, let's make the enemy chase the player. Open up the `Enemy.cs` script located under the scripts folder. Below are the variables you'll need to complete this task:  

```
#region Movement_variables
public float moveSpeed
#endregion

#region Physics_components
private Rigidbody2D rb;
#endregion

#region Targeting_variables
public Transform player
#endregion
```

- `moveSpeed` will let us control the movement speed of the enemy. It is public so that we can adjust the enemy's speed in the unity inspector. 

- `EnemyRB` will hold a reference to the enemy's Rigidbody2D. This way, we can manipulate the rigidbody's velocity property to create movement.

- `player` will hold a reference to the player's transform component. This way, we can have a easy reference to the player's position for the enemy to move towards. This can be either public or protected (protected means scripts of children game objects have access) because we will need to set this variable inside the player script.

**Task 2.1: Using the three variables above, implement the logic for the enemy's movement system: **if and only if** the player triggers the LineOfSight collider, *PlayerController.cs*'s `player` variable to the Transform of the *player* GameObject, then move the enemy towards the player's transform position. You will need to edit the `OnTriggerEnter2D()` function in the *LineOfSight.cs* script, in addition to the `Move()` and `Update()` functions in the *Enemy.cs* script.**

Functions to modify:

*LineOfSight.cs* -> `OnTriggerEnter2D()`

*Enemy.cs* -> `Move()` and `Update()`

{: .hint} 
>The variable `Player` will hold a reference to the player's Transform when it is is within line of sight. Otherwise, it will return null. How can you utilize this logic to check if the player is within the line of sight?

{: .important}
> Below is the hex code for the solution.
```
68 74 74 70 73 3A 2F 2F 79 6F 75 74 75 2E 62 65 2F 49 39 4A 47 39 6B 55 31 37 52 49 3F 73 69 3D 4B 4A 52 68 50 6E 78 72 36 54 45 48 51 71 59 69 26 74 3D 35 39 31
```

Once implemented, if the player enters the enemy's line of sight, the enemy should chase the player down. However, if you stop moving, the enemy will slowly push you off the screen. We'll address this in the next part.

### Dealing Damage to the Player 

Once the enemy makes contact with the player, it should explode and deal damage to the player. Let's implement the logic for it.

```
#region Attack_variables
public float explosionDamage;
public float explosionRadius;
public GameObject explosionObj;
#endregion
```

- `explosionDamage` is how much damage will be dealt to the player when hit with the explosion of the enemy. It is public so we can easily adjust the damage in the Unity Inspector.
- `explosionRadius` lets us control the enemy's explosion size. It is public so we can adjust the radius in the Unity Inspector
- `explosionObj` will hold a Prefab that plays the explosion animation when instantiated. 

Inside the same *Enemy* script, there is a `Explode()` function you need to implement. The function will be invoked when the player and enemy make contact. Upon contact, spawn the `explosionObj` in place of the enemy and `Debug.Log("Tons of damage")` if it catches *player* in the `explosionRadius` (you will implement the damage in a later section). Finally, destroy the enemy GameObject. After implementing `Explode()`, call `Explode()` in `OnCollisionEnter2D()` if the player collides with the enemy. 

**Task 2.2: Implement `Explode()` and invoke `Explode()` in `OnCollisionEnter2D()` if the player collides with the enemy.**

Functions to modify:

*Enemy.cs* -> `Explode()` and `OnCollisionEnter2D()`

{: .note}  
>Use a 2D circle raycast (https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Physics2D.CircleCastAll.html) to detect if the player is within the `explosionRadius`. For the direction parameter, you can just pass in `Vector2.zero`.
`CircleCastAll()` returns an array of all objects caught in the circle cast. They will be of type `RaycastHit2D` which hold the same basic properties as game objects such as the `Transform` and `tag` property. You can reference the `AttackRoutine()` back in section 1 of making the player. Checkout the `Instantiate()` documentation (https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Object.Instantiate.html) as it will prove useful when spawning the explosion animation.

Also make sure to set your attack variables in the Unity inspector before testing your code! We provide a explosion prefab located in `Assets > Prefabs` that you can drag into `explosionObj` in the unity inspector.

{: .important}
> Below is the hex code for the solution.
```
68 74 74 70 73 3A 2F 2F 79 6F 75 74 75 2E 62 65 2F 49 39 4A 47 39 6B 55 31 37 52 49 3F 73 69 3D 30 37 55 51 48 35 7A 41 52 65 6A 6E 69 6B 30 58 26 74 3D 31 32 30 37
```

To test your implementation, walk into the enemy's line of sight and let it collide with you. The enemy should die and spawn a explosion upon contact. BOOM!

![](./images/fig2.3.png) Fig 2.3

### Enemy Animation 

Right now, the enemy is a static ghost sprite. Lets give it some character by animating their walk cycle. (In this case, float cycle). 

Add an `Animator` component to the Enemy. We already provide you with a ready-to-go animation located in `Assets > Animations > Enemy`, so you can just drag and drop that in to the controller of the animator component via the unity inspector. However, if you would like to get some experience working with the animator and blendtrees (which you'll do a lot), delete the Enemy controller and follow the video below to make your own animation.

https://youtu.be/I9JG9kU17RI?si=lWHJnjz5SdM0bKCG&t=1613

### Prefabing your Enemy

Good job on creating your foe! You've crafted an adorable floating green ghost who, if you get too near, will chase after you and explode if it gets too close. Now, its time to scatter your newly created enemy prefab around the map. Please decorate to your heart's content!

In your hierarchy, create an empty `GameObject` called *Enemies*, and drag each Enemy into this empty object. This keeps your Hierarchy clean and organized!

As the curtains draw close on the stage of life's battles, let us not forget the invaluable role played by our adversaries. They are not merely obstacles to be overcome, but essential partners in our journey of self-discovery and growth. Through their opposition, we find the crucible where our character is tested and refined. Let us embrace this intricate dance with resilience, for it is in facing our foes that we unearth the depths of our strength and emerge victorious, not only over them but over our own limitations as well.

## Section 3: Health and Damage

In this fleeting pursuit for glory we call a game, the player and the enemy wish only to vanquish the other in glorious combat. But without the foundation of a fair fight, health and damage systems, neither side could hope to triumph over the other. 

Our goal for this section is to allow the player and enemy to defeat each other during the game as they exchange successful attacks.

### Health System

**Summary:**

1. Update the PlayerController and Enemy scripts to store health and damage for both enemies and players.
2. Send damage values from the players to the enemies when an attack lands, and vice versa.

Open the `PlayerController` script and take a look under the region called `Health_variables`.

```
#region Health_variables
public float maxHealth = 5;
float currHealth = 5;
#endregion
```

- `currHealth` holds the player's current amount of health.
- `maxHealth` holds the maximum amount of health that the player can hold at one time.

Now, scroll down to the `Health_functions` region, where three functions have been set up for you. These functions are responsible for changing the player’s health as the player either takes damage or heals damage. You will be implementing two of these functions.

```   
#region Health_Functions
//take damage based on value param passed in by caller
public void TakeDamage(float value){
    //TO BE IMPLEMENTED
}
//heal player
public void Heal(float value){
    //TO BE IMPLEMENTED
}
#endregion

//destroy player object and triggers end scene
private void Die(){
    Destroy(this.gameObject);
}
```
**Task 3.1: Implement `TakeDamage()`, and `Heal()` in the PlayerController script. Implement `TakeDamage()`, in the Enemy script.**

1. Using the `value` parameter, change `currHealth` inside of the `TakeDamage()` and `Heal()` functions depending on if the player is receiving damage or healing damage.
    - Call the `Die()` function whenever the player receives too much damage.
    - Limit `currHealth` to `maxHealth` when healing damage, since we do not want `currHealth` to surpass `maxHealth` when implementing the health bar.
    - Add a `Debug.Log()` to `TakeDamage()`, containing a message that displays `currHealth`'s value for debugging purposes.
    - In the `Awake()` function of *PlayerController.cs*, set `currHealth` equal to `maxHealth`. This ensures that the player starts with a full health bar when the game starts.
2. In the `Enemy` script, implement `TakeDamage()` using the same code logic in the `PlayerController` script.

Functions to modify:

*PlayerController.cs* -> `TakeDamage()`, `Heal()`, and `Awake()`

*Enemy.cs* -> `TakeDamage()`

```

Now, both the enemy and the player have a functional health system, but they do not have a way to damage one another. To add a damage system, we will be using 2D raycasts.

### Damage System

Head to the `AttackRoutine()` function within the PlayerController script. This function is called whenever the player attacks. Within the foreach loop, the player object is checking whether there are any objects with the Enemy tag inside of the attack hitbox, and returning any objects that it finds.
```    
RaycastHit2D[] hits = Physics2D.BoxCastAll(PlayerRB.position + curr_direction, Vector2.one, 0f, Vector3.zero);

foreach(RaycastHit2D hit in hits){
    Debug.Log(hit.transform.name);
    if (hit.transform.CompareTag("Enemy")){
        Debug.Log("Tons of damage");
        //TO BE IMPLEMENTED
    }
}
    
```

**Task 3.2: Fill in the logic for AttackRoutine() in the PlayerController script and Explode() in the Enemy script.**

1. Using the `transform.CompareTag()` function, call the `TakeDamage()` function inside of the enemy's `Enemy` script.
    - The variable `hit` refers to the GameObject of an enemy within the player’s attack hitbox.
    - This may be a good time to use the `GetComponent<>()` function!
2. In the `Enemy` script, call `TakeDamage()` inside of the player's `PlayerController` script through the `Explode()` function. 
    - Additionally, destroy the enemy GameObject when the enemy hitbox finds its target.
    - Look at the code from PlayerController and take note of how they access variables from GameObjects that are caught in the raycasts.
    - Make sure that you're not using the `Player` transform variable.

Functions to modify:

*PlayerController.cs* -> `AttackRoutine()`

*Enemy.cs* -> `Explode()`

Solution: 68 74 74 70 73 3A 2F 2F 79 6F 75 74 75 2E 62 65 2F 72 59 4A 52 31 41 34 4B 4F 67 6B 3F 6C 69 73 74 3D 50 4C 6B 54 71 66 35 44 42 7A 50 73 41 65 2D 70 52 35 62 44 55 64 77 48 69 43 4E 67 48 63 79 42 49 68 26 74 3D 35 36 37
```

Now the enemy and player in our game can deal damage and kill each other. Adjust the `maxHealth` value of the player in the inspector to test out if the player takes damage as expected, and they die if, and only if, the player reaches 0 health.

## Section 4: Health UI

What is a sword without its scabbard? Functional, sure, but without something to keep it contained, it will be always hanging out of place.

During the last section, we have successfully created a health and damage system for the player and the enemies. But as of right now, the player has no way of knowing how much health they have at any given moment.

In this section, we will be using Unity’s UI (User Interface) components to create a health bar for our game that displays the amount of health that the player has. In a way, we'll be making the scabbard to our gameplay.

### Health Bar

**Summary:**

1. Create a health bar and place it within the scene.
2. Getting the health bar to change dynamically depending on the player's health.

Make sure to set your player’s health to at least 5 so that it does not die to one enemy attack.

Right click on the Hierarchy and select `UI > Canvas.` This will create a `Canvas` object that will store all of your UI elements, along with an `EventSystem` object that manages interactions between the player and the UI. **Do not delete the `EventSystem` object.**

![disable view](images/fig4.1.png)
Fig 4.1

{: .highlight}
With the `Screen Space - Overlay` setting on the `Canvas` object, all UI elements within the `Canvas` will be rendered on the player’s screen above the game world. This will suit our needs of a health bar being visible to the player at all times. If you decide on adding more UI elements in the future, such as a points system or a second resource bar, they will also be displayed on top of the game world as long as they are stored inside of the `Canvas` object.

To make our health bar, we will be using a `Slider` object. Right click on the `Canvas` object and select `UI > Slider`. A slider should appear in the middle of your Scene view as a child to the `“Canvas”` object in the hierarc. 

Rename this slider to *HPSlider* and click on the crosshair under the `RectTransform`component. Hold Shift and Alt (or Shift and Option if on Mac) while clicking on the anchor preset on the top left. This should anchor your slider to the top left of the screen. To keep it from hugging the top left corner of the screen too tightly, change the `X` and `Y` positions to 5 and -5 respectively. (You are free to adjust the `Width` and `Height` of the health bar to make the bar take up more space on the screen.)

![disable view](images/fig4.2.png)
Fig 4.2

Your slider object’s transform should look something like this.

Slider objects can be placed within a settings menu for the player to change volume and more, but they can also be used for progress bars and resource bars. A key difference is whether the slider can be interacted with by the player or not.

Under the *HPSlider* object, there are three children objects titled `Background`, `Fill Area`, and `Handle Slide Area`. For our health bar, we do not need our slider to be interactable, so you can delete the `Handle Slide Area` object. Click on the `Fill Area` object and change the Left and Right transforms to 0. Next, click on the `Fill` object under the `Fill Area` and change the `Width` transform to 0. This is to allow the fill area to reach both sides of the slider completely.

We can also change the color of the slider to represent health more clearly. Look for the `Fill` object under the `Fill Area` object, and change the color to whatever color you think represents health the best (Red is typically the standard for video games). Change the color of the `Background` object to a darker or lighter shade of `Fill Area`'s.

![disable view](images/fig4.3.png)
Fig 4.3

Your slider should look something like this. Move the value slider in the Slider component of the `HPSlider` object between 0 and 1 to make sure that the health bar depletes completely and reaches the maximum.

Now, we have to connect the player’s health to the health bar with the power of scripting. Head to `PlayerController.cs` and add `using UnityEngine.UI;` to the top of the script so that we can access Unity’s UI components from the code. Under the health_variables region, create a public `Slider` variable titled `HPSlider`, which will hold a reference to the health bar in the scene itself.

Next, you will make the health bar move depending on the player's health in `PlayerController.cs`.

**Task 4.1: Update Awake(), TakeDamage(), and Heal() to support UI functionality.**

1. In `Awake()`, set `HPSlider.value` to a ratio between the player's *current* health and *maximum* health.
     - This is to make sure the scene loads in with the correct amount of health displayed.
2. Update `HPSlider.value` in `TakeDamage()` and `Heal()` under `Health_functions` the same way as in `Awake()`.
     - The order that you update UI variables matters! Make sure that the correct values are being displayed in the scene.

Functions to modify:

*PlayerController.cs*  -> `Awake()`, `TakeDamage()`, and `Heal()`

```
Head back to your Scene view and drag the *HPSlider* object to the `HPSlider` variable in the *Player* object. Test the game to see if the health bar displays the correct ratio of health when the game starts and when you take damage from an enemy.

## Section 5: Sound and Camera

In this section, you will handle all the sound aspects of the project, along with a couple bits and pieces that we need to pick up before moving on.


### Audio


First, enable the *AudioManager* object in the Hierarchy. Then, in your *Player* script, add the sounds where you want it to be played. In order to do this, you will need to add this line of code to where you want the sound to be played: `FindObjectOfType<AudioManager>().Play("SoundName");`. 

{: .note}
>In order to enable game objects: select the object you would like to enable in your hierarchy, then check the box located at the top left of your inspector.

To find the names of each sound, go into the *AudioManager* object, and click on each sound dropdown to find the *Name* field. You will need to add this line for each sound in their respective locations. The link to the tutorial with the timestamp can be found below.

**Task 5.1: Implement all sounds listed in the *AudioManager* in their respective places**

Here is a list of the sounds you'll need to implement:

- PlayerHurt
- PlayerDeath
- Explosion
- EnemyHurt
- PlayerAttack
  
{: .hint}
>Make sure to play the sound *before* the object is destroyed, or else it will not play!

{: .important}
>Potions are not yet implemented, so there is no need to add the potion effect. **You will implement the sound for the potion during the next section.**

{: .important}
> Below is the hex code for the solution.
```

```

### Bits and Pieces

Now, we want the camera to move with the player. So, click on the *CM vcam1* object in the Hierarchy, and check it. Then, in the `CinemachineVirtualCamera` component, drag your *Player* object into the Follow area. Then, go into the `Main Camera` and check the `CinemachineBrain` component. You should now be able to play the game with the camera centered on the player, as you explore the map.

Now, you should be able to play your game in the map, and have sound effects along with it! 

## Section 6: Pickups

In this section, you will implement a chest object and a health potion object, then program the functionality to open these chests and receive health potions.

**Summary:**

1. Create a health potion GameObject that heals the player's health when the player walks over it
2. Create a chest that drops health potions when the player opens it

### Setting Up  Chest and HealthPack

Right click in the hierarchy to create a new sprite GameObject `2D Object > Sprite` and rename it to `Chest`. Then, follow these steps: 

1. In your project's directory, navigate to `Assets > Sprites > Items` and drag the *chest* sprite into the *SpriteRenderer* component's *Sprite* box. Alternatively, you can click on the circle next to the *Sprite* box and search the name *chest*.

2. Inside the *SpriteRenderer* component, look under "Additional Settings", set the *Sorting Layer* to *Enemy*.

{. note}
> We are setting the sorting layer to Enemy so the chest sprite appears above the environment layer

![](./images/fig6.1.png) Fig 6.1

3. Add a *Rigidbody2D* component and a *BoxCollider2D* component. Change the *Rigidbody 2D*'s body type to **Kinematic**. Kinematic means this game object is unaffected by gravity and can only be moved by script manipulation. **Additionally, freeze both x and y positions as well as the z rotation.**

![](./images/fig6.2.png) Fig 6.2

Now, create another sprite GameObject and name it *HealthPotion*. Repeat the following steps above for *HealthPotion*, **while making sure to check the *IsTrigger* checkbox under the *BoxCollider2D* component.**

### Health Pack Script

Navigate to the Scripts folder `Assets > Scripts` and attach the *HealthPotion.cs* script to your *HealthPotion* GameObject. Double click the script to edit it. 

```
#region HealthPotion_variables
[SerializeField]
[Tooltip("amount the player heals")]
private int healAmount;
#endregion
```

- `healAmount` will be the amount of health recovered once the user walks over the health potion.
- `ToolTip` will display the message it holds when the user hovers over the healAmount variable in the unity inspector

When a player walks over a health potion, it should boost their health points and disappear; signaling to the player that the potion has been used. 

**Task 6.1: In *HealthPotion.cs* fill in the `OnTriggerEnter2D()` function so the player gains `healAmount` of health when collided with. Add the potion sound to your script as well.**

Functions to modify:

*HealthPack.cs* -> `OnTriggerEnter2D()`

{: .important}
> Below is the hex code for the solution.
```
68 74 74 70 73 3A 2F 2F 79 6F 75 74 75 2E 62 65 2F 50 6C 77 31 4F 30 55 75 5F 7A 51 3F 73 69 3D 66 74 31 61 6D 35 71 64 4F 6C 6E 77 58 37 70 52 26 74 3D 32 37 39
```

Attach the *HealthPack.cs* script to your `HealthPotion` GameObject. You can test out your implemention by using a `Debug.Log()` statement to print out your `currHealth` inside *PlayerController.cs*'s `Heal()` function and walking over the health potion with your player.

Finally, drag your *HealthPotion* GameObject into `Assets > Prefabs` to turn it into prefab.

### Chest Script

Change the *Chest* GameObject's tag to **Chest**. Navigate to the Scripts folder again and add the *Chest.cs* script to your *Chest* GameObject. Double click the script to edit it.

{: .note}
> Notice we only have a tag for chests but not potions. This is because the tag will be needed for interactions between the player and chest but the player will not be interacting with the potion besides collison detection.

Under the region `Healthpack_variables`, create a variable with type `GameObject` and name it `healthPotion`. Make sure it is public. We will use this reference to spawn health packs when chests are opened. 

When a player interacts with a chest, the chest should disappear, leaving behind a health potion for the player to pick up. 

**Task 6.2: Implement`DestroyChest()` which destroys a chest and leaves in-place a Health Potion.** 

Functions to modify:

*Chest.cs* -> `DestroyChest()`

{: .important}
> Below is the hex code for the solution.
```
68 74 74 70 73 3A 2F 2F 79 6F 75 74 75 2E 62 65 2F 50 6C 77 31 4F 30 55 75 5F 7A 51 3F 73 69 3D 51 6B 57 44 64 42 45 6B 6D 47 41 52 53 64 65 62 26 74 3D 34 35 35
```

Back in the Unity editor, with *Chest* selected, drag and drop a reference to the `HealthPotion` prefab into this variable via the Unity inspector. Then, make your `Chest` into a prefab. 

{: .note}
>You won't be able to test your implemention until you've finished the next task.

### Interacting with Pickups

We just implemented the `Open()` function for *Chest*, that when called, destroys the *Chest* game object and leaves in its place a *Health Potion*. 
As of right now, we can't interact and open the chest. Let's implement that functionality in this section.

The `Open()` function should be called whenever the player presses "E" on a chest.  

First, open up the *PlayerController.cs* script and add a conditional `if statement` inside the `Update()` function to repeatedly check if the player presses the "E" key. If the "E" key is pressed, call the *PlayerController*'s `Interact()` function; we shall implement the functionality of this function in the next step.

```
/* PlayerController.cs */

void Update() {
    if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.E)) {
        Interact();
    }
}

```

Still inside the *PlayerController.cs* script, navigate down to the Interact() function. This function, when invoked, will check if the player is facing a chest, if so, it will call that particular *Chest* instance's `Open()` function to drop a *Health Potion*.

**Task 6.3: Implement `Interact()`: use a `BoxCastAll` to check if the player is facing a `Chest` game object if so, call that `Chest`'s `Open()` function.**

Functions to modify:

*PlayerController.cs* -> `Interact()`

{: .important}
>`BoxCastAll()` works the same as `CircleCastAll()` but raycasts in the shape of a rectangle instead of a circle. We highly reccommend reading over the documentation here: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Physics.BoxCastAll.html.
For the size parameter we used 0.5f for both its width and height. Keep in mind we want to cast in the direction the player is facing. 

{: .important}
> Below is the hex code for the solution.
```
68 74 74 70 73 3A 2F 2F 79 6F 75 74 75 2E 62 65 2F 4E 74 4F 54 70 67 44 4F 7A 49 30 3F 73 69 3D 52 44 43 64 6F 46 35 74 36 68 6A 77 39 44 30 4A 26 74 3D 37 31
```

Now, scatter some chests into your map by dragging and dropping the `Chest` prefab into your scene multiple times.

![](./images/fig6.3.png) Fig 6.3

Here is a example of what your scene should look like now.

Now you should be able to walk up to the chests, press E for a health potion, and walk over the potion to gain health.

## Section 7: Menu Screens

We've come so far, you and I. Our trials and tribulations are no match for your boundless fervor for creation, and now you stand before the beast itself, sword in hand and an intent to kill.

Now that the core gameplay has been implemented, we can now round off our game with menu screens that allow the player to navigate from opening the game to playing it and vice versa. Menu screens are a quick way to add polish to your game and improve the user experience, as well as enforcing the style or theme that your game is going for.

**Summary:**

1. Create a GameManager script and UI assets for the GameManager to control
2. Create scenes for the game to switch between and implement the scene-switching logic

### Main Menu

Head to the *Scenes* folder in the Inspector, and right click to create a new scene with `Create > Scene`. Name this scene *MainMenu*, and open the scene. Create a `Canvas` (this will also make an `EventManager`), and name it *MainMenuCanvas*. 

Create a `Text` object under the new canvas and name it *TitleText*. Increase the font size to 40, and change both alignments to the centered option. Change the text to your game’s title. (You can choose this name! If you don’t care, call it *Awesome Game*) 

Create an `Image` under *MainMenuCanvas* and drag it above *TitleText* in the Hierarchy. Click on the `Anchor Preset` box on the top left of the `RectTransform` component and click on the bottom right box with 4 blue arrows extending outwards. Change the `Left`, `Right`, `Top`, and `Bottom` transforms to 0 to stretch the image toward the edges of the screen. These values determine the offset between the respective side of the screen and the asset.

![disable view](images/fig8.1.png)
Fig 8.1

Change the `Color` of the image to your choice of background color. Notice how the text now renders in front of the image in the Game view because we moved the `Text` object above the `Image` object. 

Add a `Button` object to the *MainMenuCanvas* and lower the button either in the scene or by changing the `Y` position to -75 in the `Inspector`. Access the *Text* object, the child of *Button*, and change the text to *“Start Game"*.

### Win and Lose Screens

**Task 7.1: Create two more scenes, *WinScene* and *LoseScene*, that will show up when the win and lose conditions are met respectively.**

{: .note}
> Both scenes, at minimum, will have the same components as the *MainMenu* scene, so you can duplicate the scenes to save some time. Make sure to change the components and rename the scene so that they are distinct from the main menu, and that you don't confuse yourself when hopping from scene to scene when you're editing.

{: .important}
> Below is the hex code for the solution.
``` 
68 74 74 70 73 3A 2F 2F 79 6F 75 74 75 2E 62 65 2F 41 33 78 35 69 50 6A 36 6A 6C 63 3F 6C 69 73 74 3D 50 4C 6B 54 71 66 35 44 42 7A 50 73 41 65 2D 70 52 35 62 44 55 64 77 48 69 43 4E 67 48 63 79 42 49 68 26 74 3D 34 39 
```

### Scene Management

To hold all of the scene management code, we will be using a `GameManager` script. The `GameManager` script is typically where, as the name suggests, most of the game management code is stored. Since most of the code that maintains the gameplay has been delegated to other scripts, this `GameManager` script will control scene management.

Open the `GameManager` script and take a look at the code below:

```
public static GameManager Instance = null;

#region Unity_functions
private void Awake()
{
    if (Instance == null)
	{
		Instance = this;
	} else if (Instance != this) {
		Destroy(this.gameObject);
	}
	DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject);
}
#endregion
```

- The if block checks if a `GameManager` script exists already:
    - If it doesn’t, it assigns itself to a reference that can be accessed in other scripts.
    - If it does, it destroys itself, the GameObject, to prevent itself from overwriting the existing `GameManager`.
- After the if statement, it makes sure that the `GameManager` is not deleted when the game switches between scenes, so that scripts can continue to reference `GameManager`.

Why put so much effort into maintaining a proper `GameManager` script? `GameObjects` are typically not supposed to persist between scenes. However, the `GameManager` script tends to hold important variables that correspond to all parts of the game, from scores to player information and even sound settings. Keeping a single version of the `GameManager` script by using the line `DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject)` lets the game retain its own information so that it can be used all throughout the game’s different scenes.

Once you’ve looked at the code above, add `using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;` to the top of the script. Importing the `SceneManagement` package allows us to access specific functions to move between scenes in the game.

Scroll down to the `Scene_transitions` region containing four empty functions; `StartGame()`, `LoseGame()`, `WinGame()`, and `MainGame()`. Each of these functions will run whenever a scene change is needed.

**Task 7.2: Implement `StartGame()`, `LoseGame()`, `WinGame()`, and `MainGame()`.**

1. Using `SceneManager.LoadScene()`, fill in the functions `StartGame()`, `LoseGame()`, `WinGame()`, and `MainGame()`.
	- `SceneManager.LoadScene()` uses one string argument, which is the name of the scene that needs to be loaded. 
	- Each function above should load to a different scene. Scene names are **CASE SENSITIVE**, so double-check your spelling and cases first if you run into issues.



Functions to modify:

*GameManager.cs* -> `StartGame()`, `LoseGame()`, `WinGame()`, and `MainGame()`.

{: .important}
> Below is the hex code for the solution.
```
 68 74 74 70 73 3A 2F 2F 79 6F 75 74 75 2E 62 65 2F 78 44 64 31 50 46 44 7A 4E 57 55 3F 6C 69 73 74 3D 50 4C 6B 54 71 66 35 44 42 7A 50 73 41 65 2D 70 52 35 62 44 55 64 77 48 69 43 4E 67 48 63 79 42 49 68 26 74 3D 32 30 37 
```

You have successfully implemented the necessary functions within the `GameManager` script to navigate through the UI! Attach the `GameManager` script to the *GameManager* object and turn the object into a prefab.

We will now hook up the functions to the buttons in each scene. Access the *StartButton* object under `MainMenuCanvas` and scroll to the `Button` component, where you’ll find an `OnClick()` box. Click the plus sign at the bottom right so that the box looks like the figure below. If it already looks like the figure, you do not need to add a second function.	

![disable view](images/fig8.2.png)

Drag the *GameManager* prefab into the empty object slot, and select `GameManager > StartGame()` on the dropdown menu. Now when the button is clicked, the `StartGame()` function will execute.

An important step is to head to `File > Build Settings` and click on the `Add Open Scenes` button under `Scenes In Build`. This will add *MainMenu* to the build, which will allow `SceneManager` to access the scene in order to switch to it.

{: .important}
> `SceneManager` functions can only access scenes that are contained in the build. Add scenes that you want to access into the build before testing out the `SceneManager` functions.

Run the scene and click on the "Start Game" button, ensuring that the game transitions into the main game scene, or *SampleScene*. Go ahead and switch to the other scenes as well and make sure that their respective buttons move to the right scenes.

Now, we will implement the rest of the transition functions. Open the `EndTriggerScript` script and look at the method below:

```
private void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D coll)
{
	if (coll.CompareTag(“Player))
	{
		gameObject gm = GameObject.FindWithTag(“GameController”);
		gm.GetComponent<GameManager>().WinGame();
	}
}
```

Since the `EndTriggerScript` script is attached to an invisible `GameObject` with a `BoxCollider2D` component, the method `OnTriggerEnter2D()` concludes the game when the player reaches the goal.
First, it searches the `Hierarchy` for a GameObject with the *GameController* tag. The only `GameObject` that should have this tag is the `GameManager` object.
Afterwards, it accesses `WinGame()` from the `GameManager` script, thereby moving the scene to *WinScene*.

**Task 7.3: Trigger a game over by moving the current scene to LoseScene when the lose condition is met.**

1. Using this method of ending the game, implement a lose condition in the `PlayerController` script.
	- The game should end when the player's health reaches 0.
	- The current scene should move to the scene titled *LoseScene*.

Functions to modify:

*GameManager.cs* -> ???

**Hint: Think of what typically triggers game overs in video games, and look for the function in the script that supports this game over.**
